      <h1>Fermat Point</h1>
      <p>The Fermat (or Torricelli) point is defined as the point on a triangle such that the sum of the distances between that point and the three vertices of the triangle are the minimum possible. It is also known as the 1st isogonic center, abbreviated <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/ETC.html#X13">X(13)</a>, due to the fact that the three angles formed by the point and straight lines to its triangle's vertices remain equal at all times, provided that the point is not coincident with one of the vertices. This condition occurs whenever one angle in the triangle is greater than 120&deg;, or 2&pi;/3; in such a case, the Fermat point is coincident with the vertex at which the angle occurs</p>
      <p>The interactive illustration below should help you to visualize the nature of the Fermat point. Just click-and-drag any of the three black triangle vertices to watch the the Fermat point (red) change as the triangle itself changes.</p>
